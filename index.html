    <p>Dear Participant,<br><br><br>
        In the following experiment we will show you 
        icons depicting one object in relation with the other two objects.
        Your task is to group the icons that we will present you 
        with on the left side of the screen into groups on the right. 
        Please sort them based on how similar the red objects are in terms of their 
        <strong>RELATIONSHIPS</strong>
        with the grey objects. You can create as many groups as you think are 
        appropriate. Just use the button NEW GROUP to create more groups. 
        Drag items into groups by holding down the left mouse button. 
        You may delete a group by using the DELETE button. 
        All icons within that group will be placed on the left side again. 
        You can also sort icons directly from one category into another.
        You decide which items belong together. 
        There is no right or wrong group for the icons.<br><br><br> 

        This task should take 30-40 minutes and you should do it in one sitting.
        Your first task is completed when all icons from the left side have 
        been placed into groups on the right side. 
        If you have further questions please ask the experimenter. 
        We have prepared a short example to acquaint you with the interface. 
        When you have sorted all icons, press FINISH.<br><br><br>
    
        Please press OK after you have read the instructions above 
        and answered the question below.
